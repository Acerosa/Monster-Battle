# Monster-Battle

A simple Pygame arcade game where you must catch monsters of a specific colour while avoiding the wrong ones. Use arrow keys to move and spacebar to warp. Each round increases in difficulty.


## How to Play

- Use the **arrow keys** to move the player (the knight).
- Press the **spacebar** to warp to the safe zone (bottom of the screen).
- Catch monsters that match the target colour shown at the top.
- Avoid catching the wrong coloured monsters.
- Each new round adds more monsters and becomes harder.

## How to Run

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pygame
   ```

2. Run the game:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

Make sure your working directory is set to the game folder and that the `assets/` folder with images and sounds is present.
